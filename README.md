## _Who am I?_
Well, I was born in Mexico a while back before settling in Charlotte, NC. I enjoy reading code and following the thoughts of the programmer, 
yet I aren't too fond with programming/creating software. I also enjoy the outdoors overall. I love evening drives: my mind drifts off and 
I ultimately end up in some other state while in Idaho. Yeah...there's that.

That should be it.

## _Who am I?_
I am currently living in Seattle, Washington and am studying to become a Software Engineer. This is my 4th semester at BYU-Idaho, although
winter is technically my off-track. I figured that I might as well get some extra classes in since I didn't have much else to do during 
quarantine.

## _Who am I?_
Hell my name is Daniel Gomez I am from Reisterstown Maryland. It's kind of a state that's 'way out there' on the east coast. It is not Deleware. 
Anyway I like to skateboard and I like to make music. I also like to play X-box, specifically Apex Legends. I have a girlfriend and she's pretty 
cool too. I'm super excited to work with you guys, my email is gom19007@byui.edu and my phone# is 443-537-7181.
