I wasn't exaclty sure what to say about myself, so the first few seconds will be me rambling with no goal. Alright, I got it.

## _Who am I?_
Well, I was born in Mexico a while back before settling in Charlotte, NC. I enjoy reading code and following the thoughts of the programmer, yet I aren't too fond with programming/creating software. I also enjoy the outdoors overall. I love evening drives: my mind drifts off and I ultimately end up in some other state while in Idaho. Yeah...there's that.

That should be it.
